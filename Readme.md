## How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore Projects**:
   - Each folder contains an independent project with its own dataset, analysis notebooks, and results.
   - Check the `README.md` file inside each project folder for more specific information.

2. **Run the Code**:
   - Navigate to the project folder of interest.
   - Set up the virtual environment using `requirements.txt` to ensure all dependencies are installed:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **View Results**:
   - Visualizations and reports can be found in the `visuals/` and `reports/` folders, respectively.

## Skills Demonstrated

This portfolio highlights:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and transforming datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, patterns, and insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating impactful graphs and charts using tools like Excel, Matplotlib, or Seaborn.
- **Reporting**: Summarizing findings in clear and actionable reports.
- **Technical Tools**: Utilizing Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, etc.) and Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
